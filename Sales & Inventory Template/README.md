- In the catalogue sheet, you can add products along with their buying and selling prices.
- You can set start and end dates for each product's price, allowing you to manage price changes over time.
- To update a product's price:

  - Enter the end date for the current price.
  - Copy the product entry in a new row, set the new price, and specify the new start date.
    _this will not affect past or future records in the sales and inventory sheet_
  - The new price period is automatically managed after inputting the end date.
